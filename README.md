😊 Emoji Creator - Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning
🧠 Overview

This project aims to recognize human emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset. Based on the predicted emotion, an appropriate emoji is displayed, mimicking the user’s facial expression.

The system leverages Deep Learning techniques to process image data, identify emotional states such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, and neutral, and associate them with corresponding emojis in real-time.
